**Project SpaceDefenders**

This is a personal C# game project, the purpose of this project was to try to implement what I learned from my university project RobotDodge game and apply that knowledge/skills to this personal project. Basically an application of object-oriented programming principles applied to this project.

**Instructions**

1. Download 'SplashKit' and 'MSYS2 MINGW64' online.

2. Open up MSYS2 MINGW64 Terminal and go to the directory by typing 'cd/[Enter directory pathway]'.
 
3. Now type 'mkdir [Name of project]' to create a folder for your project.

4. Now cd to that project folder.

5. Now to use SplashKit, type 'skm dotnet new console', followed by 'skm dotnet restore'.

6. Type 'skm resources' to create a resources folder for images, sounds, videos etc.

7. After that's all done and you have downloaded everything here, make sure to type 'skm dotnet run'.
