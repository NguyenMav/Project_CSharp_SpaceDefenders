**Project SpaceDefenders**

This is a personal C# game project, the purpose of this project was to try to implement what I learned from my university project RobotDodge game and apply that knowledge/skills to this personal project. Basically an application of object-oriented programming principles applied to this project.

**Instructions**

Download 'SplashKit' and 'MSYS2 MINGW64' online.

Open up MSYS2 MINGW64 Terminal and go to the directory by typing 'cd/[Enter directory pathway]'.

Now type 'mkdir [Name of project]' to create a folder for your project.

Now cd to that project folder.

Now to use SplashKit, type 'skm dotnet new console', followed by 'skm dotnet restore'.

Type 'skm resources' to create a resources folder for images, sounds, videos etc.

After that's all done and you have downloaded everything here, make sure to type 'skm dotnet run'.
